# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

## Project Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key Questions & Objectives
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data & Tools Used
The Rockbuster Stealth dataset includes comprehensive information about Rockbuster's customer profiles, payment transactions, films, staff, actors, rental history, addresses, and inventory. The primary tools used for this project are listed below:

  1. PostgreSQL & DbVisualizer: This was the relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store, map and query Rockbuster's data
  2. pgAdmin4: Web-based graphical tool to manage PostgreSQL databases
  3. Tableau: Platform on which project visualizations are created and shared
